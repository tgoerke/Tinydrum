Bass Drum based on idea by Alex Allmont
---------------------------------------
This is a small bass drum for the Atiny45 using two pots to change the
drum sound.

Schematic & original code can be found here:
http://www.alexallmont.com/avr-cheap-bass-drum-synthesis/

I just changed it into a library providing a Drum class.

For build instructions please consult the Makefile.
